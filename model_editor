1.) Model Editor
> gazebo
- Ctrl + M

- This tutorial describes the process of creating a model using the Model Editor.
- so that we don't have to write lines like an idiot

1. Graphical user interface
- The editor is composed of the following 2 areas:
    - The Palette on the left 
    	- has two tabs. 
    		- The Insert tab 
    		- lets you insert parts (links and other models) into the scene to build the model. 
    		- The Model tab 
    		- displays a list of all the parts that make up the model you are building.

    - The 3D View on the right 
    	- where you can see a preview of your model
    	- and interact with it to
    	- edit its properties 
    	- and create joints between links.

- The GUI tools on the top toolbar 
	- can be used to manipulate joints and links in the 3D View.

2. Add Links
2.1. Add simple shapes
- The model editor has three simple primitive geometries that the user can insert into the 3D view to make a link of the model.

2.1.1. On the Palette, click on the box, sphere, or cylinder icon under Simple Shapes.
	- Move your mouse cursor over the 3D view to see the visual appear, and click/release anywhere to add it to the model.
    - Tip: You can press Esc to cancel adding the current link attached to the mouse cursor.

2.1.2. Add meshes
- To add a custom mesh,
    - Click on the Add button under Custom Shapes, 
    	- which pops up a dialog that 
    	- lets you find the mesh you want to add.

    - Click on Browse button 
    - and use the file browser to find the mesh file on your local machine. 
    - If you know the path of the mesh file, you can enter it directly in the text field box next to the Browse button. 
    - Gazebo 8 supports 
    	- COLLADA (.dae), 
    	- 3D Systems (.stl),
    	- Wavefront (.obj) and
    	- W3C SVG (.svg) files.

    - Click Import to load the mesh file. Then, add it to the 3D view.

3. Create Joints
- The model editor supports creating several types of joints between links in the model being edited. 
- To create a joint:

3.1. Click on the joint icon on the tool bar. 
- This brings up the Joint Creation Dialog
- which allows you to specify different properties of the joint you want to create. 
- As you can see in the dialog, the default joint type is a Revolute joint.

3.2. Begin by moving your mouse over the link you wish to create a joint 
	- for to see it being highlighted and click on it. 
	- This link will be the parent link of the joint.

3.3. Next, move your mouse to the link which you would like to be the child link of the joint. 
	- Click on it to see a colored line connecting the two links and a joint visual attached to the child link.

	- The line representing the joint is color-coded. Play around with different joint types to see the colors.

- The joint visual consists of RGB axes 
	- which help to give an idea of the coordinate frame of the joint. 
	- ***The yellow arrow indicates the primary axis of the joint. 
		- For example, in the case of a revolute joint,
		- this is the axis of rotation.

3.4. Once you have specified all the desired properties of the joint in the Joint Creation Dialog, 
- **click on the Create button at the bottom to finalize joint creation.

- Tip: You can press Esc any time to cancel the joint creation process.
- come on, it's just click joint -> click parent -> click child -> click create

4. Edit your model
- Tip: If you make a mistake, click the undo button on the toolbar to undo the last action.
- Tip: All measurements are in meters.

4.1. Edit links
- The model editor supports editing properties of a link which you would also find in its SDF.
- To edit a link's properties: 
	- Double-click on the link 
	- or right click and 
		- select Open Link Inspector. 
	- A dialog window will appear which contains Link, Visual, and Collision property tabs.

- As an example, try changing the link pose and visual colors. 
- Once you are done, click on OK to close the inspector.

4.2. Edit joints
- As mentioned earlier, joint properties can also be edited. 
- These are properties that you would find in the joint SDF.

- To edit a joint:
	- Double-click on the line connecting the links 
	- or right click on it and
		- select Open Joint Inspector.
		- The joint inspector will appear.

- As an example, try changing the joint pose and joint type. 
- Once you are done, click on OK to close the inspector.

4.3. Saving your model
- Saving will create
	- a directory,
	- SDF and
	- config files for your model.

- As an exercise, let's build a simple car and save it. 
- The car will have a box chassis and four cylinder wheels. 
	- Each wheel will be connected to the chassis with a revolute joint

- Once you're happy with the model you created, 
	- go to the Model tab in the left panel and
	- give it a name.

- To save the model, 
	- choose File, then Save As (or hit Ctrl+S) in the top menu.
	- A dialog will come up where you can choose the location for your model.

4.4. Exit
- When you're done creating the model and you've saved it, 
- go to File and then 
- Exit Model Editor.
- Your model will show up in the main window.

4.5. Edit existing models
- Rather than creating a model from the ground up; 
- you can also edit existing models that are already in the simulation.

- To edit an existing model:
	- Make sure you have saved the model you created, 
	- and you have exited the model editor.
	- Alternatively, start from a fresh Gazebo instance.

    - Insert a model from the Insert tab on the left. 
    	- For example, let's insert a Simple Arm.

    - Right click on the model you just inserted and select Edit Model.

- Now you are in the model editor 
- and you are free to add new links to the model 
- or edit existing ones

2.) Extrude SVG files

- This tutorial describes the process of extruding SVG files,
	- which are 2D images, 
	- to create 3D meshes for your models in Gazebo.

- It is sometimes easier to design part of a model in a program like Inkscape or Illustrator.

- This tutorial will show you how to make a custom wheel as an .svg in Inkscape, 
- and import it into Gazebo so that it can be attached to a robot.

1. Document preparation
- Start Inkscape. 
	- This will create a blank document. 

1.1. First, lets change the document size to better accommodate our wheel: 
	- under the File->Document properties menu, 
		- select the Page tab
		- and change the document size to a custom size
			- of 100.0 x 100.0 mm.

	Then, in the same dialog, 
		-select the Grids tab, 
			- press the New button to create a custom grid. 
			- Then, check 
				- the Enabled,
				- Visible,
				- and Snap to visible grid lines only options.
			- Change Spacing X and Spacing Y to be 10.

- You should end up with a document looking like this:
	- a square one a white background

2. Draw
- You can use the different tools (pen, text, stars and shapes, etc.) to create your geometry. 
- In this example, the wheel is made from circles 
	- (pressing the Shift Key you can start your circle from the center, 
	- and using the CTRL key allows you to keep the roundness of the shape). 
	- It is possible to combine shapes together,
	- making sure that paths are closed and that the part has a proper thickness.

- Note: a stick figure or two circles that touch each other would not result in valid Gazebo models. 
- The SVG paths must create an closed contour with holes, 
	- ** where the holes cannot touch the contour or other holes.
	- Holes inside holes are treated as solid parts
		- (and they can have holes, too).

- Gazebo only imports paths, 
- but it's easy with Inkscape to transform any shape to a path.
	- Select Select All from the Edit menu.
	- Then select the Path -> Object to Path menu item. 
	- This will transform every object into separate paths and sub paths.
	- *** This transformation is irreversible,
	- so if you transform text into paths, you will not be able to alter the text.

- Gazebo does not support grouping. Use the Ungroup from the Object menu to separate groups of paths.

3. Saving your drawing
- Save your drawing to an SVG file you can use later in Gazebo. 
- Use the Save option from the File menu.

4. Create a Gazebo Model
- SDFormat does not support SVG directly; 
	- it supports 2D poly lines. 
	- The Gazebo Model Editor has an import mechanism that extracts the poly lines from SVG files, 
	- and saves them as an SDF model file.

- Launch Gazebo 
	- and Select Model Editor from the Edit menu to enter the Gazebo Model Editor mode (as opposed to the simulation mode).
		- Then press the Add button in the Custom Shapes section of the Insert tab.
			- This will open the Import Link dialog from where you can select the SVG file by pressing the Browse button.
			- Once the file has been selected, 
				- press the Import button to open the Extrude Link dialog
				- The dialog allows you to set parameters of the extrusions:
    				- Thickness: How thick the link will be. 
    					- This corresponds to the extrusion height in the z axis. 
    					- For the SVG path shown on the right, 
    					- the axis of extrusion is outwards from the screen.

    				- Resolution: How many pixels in your SVG correspond to a meter. 
    					- The default value (3543.3 px/m) 
    					- corresponds to 90 dpi (dots per inch), 
    					- which is the default resolution for several editors, including Inkscape. 
    					- If your model shows up the size you'd like in Inkscape when you display the units as meters,
    					- you shouldn't change the resolution value.

    				- Samples per segment: This indicates into how many segments to divide each of the curved paths in the SVG. 
    					- The more segments, the more complex your link will be. 
    					- It doesn't change anything for straight paths.

- On the right, you can see the path extracted from your SVG. 
- The red points are the summit of the triangulation of the extruded 3D model.

- Set the thickness of the wheel to 0.025 m, 
- and press OK. 
- Your new link should appear in the 3D view.

- A new link is created, 
- and it comes with a default collision shape 
	- that is a copy of the generated 3D mesh.

- Next, select Exit Model Editor from the File menu. 
- Gazebo will prompt you to save the new model to disk. 
- Press the Save and Exit button on the Exit dialog, 
- and the Save Model dialog will appear.

- Set the name of the new model to "HollowWheel", 
- and fill in the information under the Advanced Options section. 
- Press the Save button.
